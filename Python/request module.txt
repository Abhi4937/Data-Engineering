python

shebang: #!
for python: "#!/usr/bin/python3"
	A shebang, also known as a hashbang or hashpling, is the character sequence "#!" that appears at the beginning of a script in Unix-like operating systems. It is followed by the path to the interpreter that should be used to execute the script.
    we can run directly as ./script.py and we don't require to explicitly use "python script.py"
Note:1. We can use custom path/to/python this path is basically the exact path where u have installed python or where python.exe resides
	 2. Always check the permission of the file/folder before executing.

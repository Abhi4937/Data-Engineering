Hello, Cloud Gurus.
This lesson is going to be about testing application
services using AWS Device Farm.
During this lesson, we'll go over a few different things.
We'll talk about what Device Farm actually is
and what its purpose is.
We'll talk about the different ways that you can use it
to test and then we'll wrap everything up
with some good old fashioned exam tips.
So what is AWS Device Farm?
Device Farm is an application testing service
that you can use for testing and interacting with Android,
iOS, and web applications.
The cool thing about this service is it uses
actual phones and actual tablets that are hosted by AWS.
Now, Device Farm offers 2 primary testing methods.
The first is automated.
So in this case, you would upload scripts
or use built-in tests that are provided for you
to automate and run tests in parallel on mobile devices,
so phones and tablets.
You can also do what is called remote access testing.
And this is really neat.
You can actually remote in and you can swipe,
gesture, and even interact with the devices
in real time via web browsers.
So you're literally interacting with the device
just via a browser, and it's that simple.
So let's go over a quick scenario and exam tip.
Now, if you see a scenario on the exam and it mentions
requiring application testing on mobile devices in AWS,
and more specifically, needing actual phones or tablets
for automated testing, think AWS Device Farm.
That is a key indicator that you should be leveraging
this service in your architecture plans.
And that's it.
Let's go ahead and wrap this one up, short and sweet.
When you're ready, I'll see you in the next one.

Okay. Hello Cloud Gurus and welcome to this lecture.
In this lecture, we're going to look
at centralizing our WAF Management
via AWS Firewall Manager.
So we'll start off with exploring what Firewall Manager is
then we'll look
at how we can manage security across multiple accounts.
Then we'll look at the benefits
of Firewall Manager and then we'll go onto my exam tips.
So what is Firewall Manager?
Well, basically it's a security management service
in a single pane of glass.
And this allows you to centrally set
up and manage Firewall rules across multiple AWS accounts
and applications in AWS organizations.
So that's all it is.
It's a single pane of glass
for managing your Firewall rules across multiple accounts
and applications using AWS organizations.
So using Firewall Manager, you can create new AWS WAF rules
for your application load balancers,
API gateways, Amazon CloudFront distributions, et cetera.
And you can also mitigate DDoS attacks using
AWS Shield Advance for your application load balancers,
Elastic IP addresses, CloudFront distributions, and more.
So the benefits of Firewall Manager is
that it is a single pane of glass,
that it simplifies the management of firewall rules
across your accounts and you can also ensure compliance
of existing and new applications.
So Firewall Manager automatically enforces security
policies that you create across existing
and newly created resources across multiple accounts.
So just going into the exam,
if you see a scenario about multiple AWS accounts
and resources that need to be secured centrally
I want you to think of AWS Firewall Manager.
So that is it for this lecture, everyone.
If you have any questions, please let me know.
If not, feel free to move on to the next lecture.
Thank you.

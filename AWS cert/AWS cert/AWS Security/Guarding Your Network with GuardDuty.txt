Okay, hello Cloud Gurus
and welcome to this lecture.
In this lecture we're going to look
at how you can guard your network with GuardDuty.
So to begin with, we'll look at what is GuardDuty,
we'll look at the different features of it,
we'll look at how you can set it up
and then we'll move on to my exam tips.
So what is GuardDuty?
Well, it's a threat detection service
that uses machine learning to continuously monitor
for malicious behavior.
And it's basically looking for things
like unusual API calls or calls known
from a malicious IP address.
And it also looks at things like attempts
to disable CloudTrail logging,
unauthorized deployments, compromised instances,
and then reconnaissance by would be attackers as well
as port scanning and failed logins.
So in terms of GuardDuty's features,
basically alerts appear in the GuardDuty console
and also in CloudWatch Events.
And it receives feeds from third parties
like Proofpoint and CrowdStrike, as well as AWS Security
about known malicious domains and IP addresses.
And it monitors your CloudTrail logs,
it monitors your VPC Flow Logs
and it can also monitor your DNS logs as well.
And essentially it allows you to centralize threat detection
across multiple AWS accounts.
And you can also have automated responses built in
using CloudWatch Events and Lambda
and it gives you machine learning and anomaly detection.
So basically GuardDuty is threat detection with AI.
It takes 7 to 14 days to set up a baseline,
so it's basically looking for what is normal behavior
on your account.
And once active, you'll see findings
on the GuardDuty console and in CloudWatch Events
only if GuardDuty behavior it considers a threat.
In terms of GuardDuty's pricing,
you get 30 days free
and then your charges are based
on the quantity of your CloudTrail Events
and the volume of DNS and VPC Flow Logs data.
So onto my exam tips.
Going into the exam, just remember what GuardDuty is
and what it allows you to do.
It uses AI to learn what normal behavior looks like
in your account
and to alert you of any abnormal or malicious behavior.
And it updates a database of non-malicious domains
using external feeds from third parties.
And it monitors your CloudTrail Logs, your VPC Flow Logs,
and your DNS logs.
And then all the findings will appear
in the GuardDuty dashboard.
CloudWatch Events can be used to trigger a Lambda function
to address a threat,
so you can have a proactive threat response
that's completely automated.
So if you see any scenario-based questions
where it's talking about using AI and automation
to protect your whole AWS account
and to monitor things like CloudTrail,
VPC Flow Logs, DNS logs, et cetera,
I want you to think of AWS GuardDuty.
So that is it for this lecture, everyone.
If you have any questions, please let me know.
If not, feel free to move on to the next lecture.
Thank you.

Okay. Hello Cloud Gurus and welcome
to this lecture and this lecture.
We're going to look
at how we can log API calls using CloudTrail.
So first we'll explore what CloudTrail is.
We'll then look at a network diagram as to how it works.
We'll then look at how CloudTrail does its logging
and then we will move on to our exam tips.
So what is CloudTrail?
Well, basically it increases visibility
into your user and resource activity
by recording AWS management console actions and API calls.
And you can identify which users and accounts called AWS,
the source IP address from which the calls were made,
and even when the calls occurred.
So I want you to think
of CloudTrail as CCTV monitoring for your AWS account.
All it is doing is tracking API calls,
who made them, and when they made them.
And so it works like this.
Basically, we've got our end user
we've got our control plane, which is our public API
which is essentially just our interface into AWS.
And then that goes in and makes API calls to the AWS cloud.
So we might be calling DynamoDB
we might be setting up a DynamoDB table.
We might be storing files in S3 or deleting them.
We might be provisioning an EC2 instance, et cetera.
So when our user goes and does this
every single API call is logged
in an S3 bucket using CloudTrail.
Things that aren't logged though is RDP or SSH traffic.
So it's not like CloudTrail can go in there
and log what command somebody's entering
in using SSH to EC2.
It's only going to basically log the API calls made to AWS
and this includes anything that you do in the console.
So what is logged when it comes to CloudTrail?
Well, metadata around API calls, the identity
of the API caller, the time of the API call,
the source IP address of the API call, the request
parameters, and the response elements returned
by the service.
So what CloudTrail allows is after the fact
incident investigation.
So if something has happened and you need to
investigate what that was, you can basically do it
through your CloudTrail logs.
It also gives you near real-time intrusion detections.
So you can basically integrate CloudTrail
with Lambda functions, for example, and it'll give you
an intrusion detection system that you can customize.
And it also gives you industry and regulatory compliance.
So just remember that CloudTrail is basically just CCTV
for your AWS account.
It logs all API calls made to your AWS account
and it stores these logs in S3.
Now in the exam, you're going to get a whole bunch
of different scenario questions and they'll always try
and confuse you
between let's say CloudTrail and CloudWatch or CloudTrail
and Amazon Inspector
or Trusted Advisor, et cetera, et cetera.
So just remember what CloudTrail is.
It's really, really important.
It's just a CCTV system for monitoring and logging what goes
on in your AWS account using the API calls or the console.
So that is it for this lecture, everyone.
If you have any questions, please let me know.
If not, feel free to move on to the next lecture.
Thank you.

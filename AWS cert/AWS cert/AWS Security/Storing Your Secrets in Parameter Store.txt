Okay, hello Cloud Gurus,
and welcome to this very quick lecture on Parameter Store.
So storing your secrets in Parameter Store.
So first thing we're going to do is explore
what Parameter Store is,
then we'll look at the cost,
we'll then look at the limitations,
and we'll go onto my exam tips.
So what is Parameter Store?
Well, it's the capability of AWS Systems Manager
that provides secure, hierarchical storage
for configuration data management and secrets management.
So you can store things like passwords, database strings,
Amazon Machine Image IDs, license codes,
all as parameter values.
And you can store values as plain text or as encrypted data.
And the great thing about Parameter Store is it's free.
Now I know what you're all thinking,
you're like, "Well, I just watched a video
on Secrets Manager and Parameter Store
sounds exactly the same."
Well, Parameter Store is free, Secrets Manager costs money,
and there is 2 big limits to Parameter Store.
So there's a limit to the number of parameters
that you can store, and currently this is set at 10,000,
and there is no key rotation with Parameter Store.
So basically going into the exam,
you're going to get scenario-based questions
where you have to choose Parameter Store or Secrets Manager.
And if you are trying to minimize your cost,
then you should choose Parameter Store.
If you need more than 10,000 parameters, key rotation,
or the ability to generate passwords using CloudFormation
then you want to use Secrets Manager.
And that's all you need to know
about Parameter Store going into your exam.
So that is it for this lecture everyone.
If you have any questions, please let me know,
if not, feel free to move on to the next lecture.
Thank you.

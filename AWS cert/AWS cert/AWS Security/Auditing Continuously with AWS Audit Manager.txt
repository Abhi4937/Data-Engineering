Okay.
Hello Cloud Gurus and welcome to this lecture.
In this lecture, we're going to look
at how we can do continuous auditing
with AWS Audit Manager.
So we're going to have a look at what Audit Manager is.
We'll look at its use cases
and then we'll go to my exam tips.
So, what is Audit Manager?
Well basically,
it allows you to continuously audit your AWS usage.
And make sure you stay compliant
with industry standards and regulations.
And Audit Manager is an automated service,
that produces reports specific to auditors
for things like PCI compliance, GDPR, et cetera.
So all it is, is it's a way of continuously
auditing your AWS accounts.
You don't need to do it manually
and then revisit it like 3 months
later when your auditors are doing another audit.
This does it continuously and produces the reports for you.
So you can transition from manual
to automated evidence collection.
So it allows you to produce automated reports for auditors
and reduces the need to compile these reports manually.
You get continuous auditing and compliance.
So it works on a continuous basis,
so that as your AWS environment grows and changes,
you can produce automated reports
to evaluate your environment against industry standards,
such as PCI compliance.
And it allows you to do internal risk assessments.
You can create a new framework from the beginning.
Or you can customize pre-built frameworks.
You can also launch assessments to automatically
collect evidence, helping you validate
if your internal policies are being followed.
So that's where you would use Audit Manager.
So going into the exam,
if you see a scenario question where it's talking
about continuous auditing to a particular standard,
could be HIPPA, could be GDPR,
could be PCI compliance.
I just want you to think of AWS Audit Manager.
So, that is it for this lecture, guys.
If you have any questions, please let me know.
If not, feel free to move on to the next lecture.
Thank you.

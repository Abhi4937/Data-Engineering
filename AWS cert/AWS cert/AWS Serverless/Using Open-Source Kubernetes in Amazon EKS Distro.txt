Hello, Cloud Gurus.
In this lesson,
we'll begin looking at Using Open-Source Kubernetes
in Amazon EKS Distro.
Now this lesson is pretty short and sweet.
We're going to look at an overview
of what Amazon EKS Distro is.
And then we'll finish things up
pretty quickly with exam tips and some takeaways.
So, what is Amazon EKS Distro?
So EKS-D, which is the short form,
is a Kubernetes distribution based on and used by
Amazon EKS.
It has the same versions and dependencies
that are deployed by Amazon EKS itself.
But the big difference is
that EKS-D is fully managed by you,
which is unlike Amazon EKS,
which is managed by AWS.
You can run this anywhere,
literally anywhere.
On-premises, in the cloud, or even somewhere else.
You just have to realize,
it's your responsibility.
So you're fully responsible for upgrading
and managing your platforms,
as opposed to being able to lean on Amazon EKS
to do that for you.
And that's it.
Like I said, it's pretty short and sweet.
So let's have some really brief exam tips
and takeaways, for you to take with you.
Some keywords to look out for
are questions related to self-managed
Kubernetes deployments that could be similar
to Amazon EKS.
You always want to use this Distro when you need to
run versioned deployments of clusters outside
of AWS-managed services
while still maintaining the same type
of dependencies and requirements.
Now, this is not commonly appearing on exams,
and it essentially functions like EKS Anywhere.
Now that's going to do it.
Again, like I said, this is a very short and sweet lesson.
Let's end things here and then I'll see you in the next one.

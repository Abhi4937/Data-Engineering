Welcome back Cloud Gurus.
This lesson is titled
Deploying GraphQL Interfaces in AWS AppSync.
Now, this is going to be a very short lesson.
We're just going to talk about what is AWS AppSync,
and then we're going have some exam tips,
and important takeaways.
So, what is it?
Well, it's a robust and scalable
GraphQL interface used for application developers.
It allows them to easily combine data
from multiple data sources,
like Amazon DynamoDB and AWS Lambda.
It enables developers to easily interact
with their data via GraphQL.
Now, GraphQL is a data language
that enables applications to fetch data from servers.
If you're a front end developer,
you're likely at least familiar
with this term and technology.
However, if you're not familiar with it,
it does offer many different benefits
over traditional gateways and languages
as it encourages declarative coding,
and it works seamlessly
with a lot of modern tools and frameworks.
This includes things like React, React Native,
iOS, and Android development.
And that's pretty much it for the lesson.
So, let's just have a few exam tips
that you should be aware of in case this pops up.
The first is that you just need to know,
this is a scalable GraphQL interface.
Its target audience is for application developers,
especially frontend development.
So, look for keywords like GraphQL,
fetching of app data, declarative coding,
or even frontend app data fetching.
These are scenarios that might be a great fit
for AWS AppSync and like I promised, short and sweet.
Let's go ahead and we'll end here,
and then I'll see you in the next lesson.

[Ryan Kroonenburg] Okay, hello cloud gurus
and welcome to this lecture.
In this lecture we're going to look
at Amazon Machine Images or AMIs.
We're gonna look at the two different types
that you can have.
So we're going to look at EBS volumes versus Instance store.
So we're going to first explore what an AMI is.
We're going to look at the five things
you can base your AMI on,
then we're going to compare EBS volumes to instance store.
Then we'll look at instance store volumes, EBS volumes,
and we'll do a demo and then we will go on to our exam tips.
So what is an AMI?
Well, it's an Amazon Machine Image
and this provides the information
required to launch an instance
and you must specify an AMI when you launch an instance.
And we basically have seen this in the console demos
leading up to this lecture.
So when we were selecting our Amazon Linux 2 AMI,
that's the AMI that we were choosing.
It's just an Amazon Machine Image.
So the five things that you can base your AMI on
our region and our operating system, the architecture,
so whether it's 32-bit or 64-bit, the launch permissions,
and most importantly the storage
for your root device volumes.
That's where your operating system is installed.
And all AMIs are categorized as either being backed
by Amazon EBS or by instance store.
So with EBS, the root device
for an instance launch from the AMI is an EBS volume
created from an Amazon EBS snapshot.
So it's what we've been looking at already.
Whereas for instance store, the root device
for an instance launch from the AMI
is an instance store volume,
which is created from a template that's stored in Amazon S3.
So that brings us onto instance store volumes.
So instance store volumes are sometimes
called ephemeral storage.
So instance store volumes cannot be stopped
if the underlying host fails,
so the underlying physical piece of hardware,
so it could be a physical server.
If that fails, then you're going to lose your data.
You can however reboot the instance
without losing your data.
So ephemeral storage is basically means
it's not going to be saved if the instance is stopped.
If your underlying host does fail,
you're gonna lose your data.
That's all you need to remember going into your exam.
If you delete the instance,
you are going to lose the instance store volume.
So that instance store volume is only ever going to exist
while the hardware is functioning
and you cannot go ahead and stop the volume.
And obviously if you delete that instance
then you're going to lose that instance store volume.
Now EBS volumes, they can be stopped.
You do not lose the data on the instance if it's stopped.
You can also reboot an EBS volume and not lose your data
and by default the root device volume
will be deleted on termination.
However, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volumes
with EBS volumes.
So if you see anything about ephemeral storage,
think instance store.
If you need consistent and permanent storage,
think EBS volumes.
Okay, so here I am in the AWS console.
If I click on EC2, I've got an instance
that I've been running throughout this course
called MyServer1.
We click on it, we can go ahead
and have a look at the storage.
We can see that's an eight gig volume that's attached,
it's not encrypted and we have Delete on termination.
So if I delete MyServer1,
it will delete this underlying storage device.
So the underlying volume as part of the termination process.
Let's go back to our dashboard
and we're gonna create a couple more instances.
The first one we're going to just say delete,
we'll call it delete on termination.
No this is very simple.
And we're gonna do an Amazon Linux AMI.
We're gonna leave everything as default.
Our key pair is just MyKeyPair.
Gonna do an existing security group.
So my launch wizard that I created earlier.
And then in here we've got our volumes.
So right now we've got our Configure storage.
We can click on Advanced, knew I was a bit funny
if we want to be able to make sure
that this is not deleted on termination.
You just need to click in there.
And here we've got Delete on termination, so we just hit No
and now it'll not delete on termination.
Just gonna hit Hide details.
I don't need any files systems.
I'm gonna scroll down and then I'm gonna go ahead
and launch my instance.
So this is now launching an instance.
And this instance essentially, if I delete that instance,
the underlying root device volume won't be deleted.
We go back to my Instances.
So we've got our Deleteontermination,
which is now pending.
Let's go ahead and launch another instance.
And this will be our ephemeral instance.
And this will be using instance store as opposed to EBS.
So we'll call it Instancestore, our instance.
Now in order to get this, what we need to do
is we need to go down to here
and we need to click on Browse more AMIs,
go over to Community AMIs
and you just wanna minimize all these.
And then eventually you'll get your root device type
and we want an instance store device type.
So I'm gonna use the Amazon one here.
Gonna go ahead and hit Next,
unfortunately because it is instance store, it's a C3 large.
So this is gonna cost me money.
You might not want to do this,
you might just want to watch along yourself.
And I'm gonna do MyKeyPair,
leave everything else as default.
Same security group, launch wizard one.
And then I'm gonna go ahead and launch this instance.
So this is now launching our InstanceStore.
So essentially we have three instances.
We've got MyServer, which has delete on termination
for its storage device.
As you can see over here, delete on termination.
If I click on our Deleteontermination-NO,
it hopefully will be able to show us
that even though it's not provisioned yet.
So delete on termination no.
And then our InstanceStore in here is now pending.
So this one is up and running.
So if I do go ahead and let's just test it.
So well, let's test it with this one first.
So I'm gonna go to Instance state
and I'm gonna go Terminate instance.
Terminate.
If we have a look at our storage
and if we have a look at the volume ID,
it ends in A2E.
So if we go down to my volumes,
eventually this A2E is going to disappear
because it has delete on termination.
So I'm just gonna pause the video
and wait for this to disappear.
So if I just refresh this now we've got our A2E
and you can see that that has disappeared
because we had delete on termination turned on.
If I go back over to my instances and just close this
and hit Refresh, we'll be able to see that
MyServer has now been terminated.
This one is up and running,
and then this one is still pending.
So delete on termination.
If we click in here
and we have a look at our storage,
we can see that the volume ID ends in BFC.
If I then go to my Instance state
and hit Terminate, I'm sure you will realize
that essentially it's not going to terminate this instance.
Sorry, it's not going to terminate the EBS volume.
Let's go ahead and hit Terminate.
So that is now terminating this EC2 instance.
I'm just gonna pause the video
and wait for it to be terminated.
If we note the volume ID ends in BFC, gonna hit Refresh
and we can now see that this has been terminated.
However, if I go over to my volumes,
we can see it persists here.
So it hasn't been deleted on termination.
We go back to my EC2 dashboard
and have a look at my instance store volume.
It is now up and running.
Let's see what would happen if I try and stop this instance.
What do you think would happen?
As you remember at the beginning of this lecture,
we said that you cannot basically stop instance store ones.
See it says it does not have an EBS route device type
and cannot be stopped.
So if this instance store was running on a piece of hardware
that subsequently failed
and the instance went down, that would be it.
You would lose everything on the route device volume.
So it doesn't persist.
It's not like EBS.
And actually all EC2 instances
used to just be instance stores and customers would complain
'cause they're like, well, why would I move my data
onto Amazon if there's an underlying hardware failure
and I just suddenly lose all my data?
So that's when EBS became a thing.
So that is instance store in a nutshell.
You just really need to remember that you can't stop it.
And if for some reason that the hard drive
or the hardware underneath it fails,
you will lose all your data using instance store.
It's often referred to as ephemeral storage.
What you can do is go in and terminate the instance.
And that's what I've just done there.
'Cause that instance is costing me lots of money
'cause it is a much bigger instance.
So onto my exam tips,
my EBS volumes versus my instance store volumes.
Instance store volumes
are sometimes called ephemeral storage,
and that is because the data is ephemeral.
So instance store volumes cannot be stopped.
If the underlying host fails,
you are going to lose your data,
whereas EBS-backed instances can be stopped
and you're not going to lose the data on this instance
if it's stopped.
You can reboot both EBS volumes and instance store volumes
and you will not lose your data.
However, by default,
both root volumes will be deleted on termination.
But with EBS volumes, you can actually tell AWS
to keep the root device volume,
which is exactly what we did just then.
And just remember going into the exam
that an AMI is just a blueprint for an EC2 instance.
So it has things like the CPU architecture,
whether it's got instance store or EBS volumes
or what operating system it is, et cetera, et cetera.
So that is it for this lecture everyone,
if you have any questions, please let me know.
If not, feel free to move on to the next lecture.
Thank you.

Okay, hello Cloud Gurus and welcome
to the end of this section of the course.
So, as I mentioned at the beginning of this section,
currently none of these services are on the exam.
So we only covered them off at a very high level
and what their use cases are.
So we only have 2 services in the media section.
So we've got Elastic Transcoder,
this is where you basically convert your video files
into optimized versions for particular devices.
Basically, I record on an iMac, for example.
And then when I upload this video to Elastic Transcoder
it's going to convert the video format
so that you can watch on an Android device,
or on an iPad, or something, you know, a laptop, et cetera.
So that's all Elastic Transcoder does,
it optimizes your media files for particular devices.
So just remember that going into your exam.
And then, Amazon Kinesis Video Streams.
So if you have a scenario-based question
about video streaming at scale from millions of devices
so think Ring, for example, then think
of Amazon Kinesis Video Streams.
So that is it for this section of the course, guys.
If you have any questions, please let me know.
If not, feel free to move on to the next lecture, thank you.
